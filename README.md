# CUNY-Hackathon-2021
This is my submission for the CUNY Hackathon 2021.
It is a Covid Safety Quiz that allows users to take a quick assessment about their personal habits regarding Covid-19 safety based on current CDC guidance.
This project is meant to inform and encourage users to make improvements on their behavior where necessary.
